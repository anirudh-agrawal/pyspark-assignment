Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Indian weather data from 2000-2013<br>

The dataset contains information from over 1300 weather stations distributed over 535 districts in India. It contains major parameters such as Minimum Temperature(C), Maximum Temperature(C), Precipitation(mm) and Relative Humidity. The data is available as daily readings at station level.

The data has been analysed using PySpark and Tableau. The readings were aggregated at district level before analysis. Most of the analysis is carried out at a monthly level.
